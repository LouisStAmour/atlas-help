# Organization Accounts

To create an organization:

1. Create a personal account. You'll use this to create and adminstrate
the organization. You'll be able to add other users as owners of the
organization, so it won't be tied solely to your account.

2. Visit the [organizations](/organizations) page to create the
organization.

3. In order to add other users to the organization, you'll need to
upgrade your account and subscribe to the "organization" plan.
