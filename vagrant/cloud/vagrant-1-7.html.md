# Vagrant 1.7 Installation

Atlas features such as Vagrant Share, easy box URLs, and private
boxes requires Vagrant 1.7 or later. You can download the latest version
of Vagrant from the
[Vagrant download page](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).

You can verify that you're running Vagrant 1.7.0 by running `vagrant -v`
and verifying that the output is "Vagrant 1.7.0". You may also be running
a later version, which would be okay.
