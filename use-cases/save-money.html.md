# Save money and reduce server fleet size by optimizing resource utilization

<!--
The perfectly optimized datacenter uses 100% of compute resources. At under 100% utilization, resources sit unused and represent excessive cost. But in reality companies are forced purchase more servers than necessary to protect against traffic surges, surprise downtime, or other extraneous factors. This means that for most of the year, resources are idle providing no value while still retaining cost. For companies in the cloud, resource optimization is an easier road since they do not have to buy physical servers. Instead, the server fleet can expand and contract based on traffic volume. In order for this process to be dynamic, an organization must have knowledge of traffic volume, existing compute resources, and the ability to quickly provision or destroy server instances to match traffic volume to compute resources. 

Atlas exposes information to calculate current resource utilization. Then based on simple rules, Atlas can expand and contract the size of the server fleet. For example a rule could be "Always keep the CPU usage on web servers between 80-90%." Since Atlas has all the information necessary, autoscaling and self-recovery on any infrastructure becomes a simpler, configurable process.
