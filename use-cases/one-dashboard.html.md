# Use one dashboard to monitor and maintain infrastructure on any infrastructure

Atlas is a unified dashboard for developing, deploying, and maintaining applications. For the first time ever, developers and operators have a unified view to manage and provide visibility for servers, containers, VMs, configuration management, service discovery, and additional operations services. Companies who adopt Atlas will be protected against future infrastructure paradigm shifts by having Atlas focus on common, high-level workflows that are generic to application delivery across any system. DevOps teams can configure an application in Atlas and deploy it on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Compute Engine (GCE), Heroku, DigitalOcean, OpenStack, and more.
