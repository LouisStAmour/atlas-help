# Use one workflow to move from development to production

Application delivery is an increasingly complex problem with applications running on public clouds, private clouds, physical servers, virtualized servers, in containers, and hybrid combinations of these. As more operations choices are added to your data center, whether through a growing development team, company acquisitions, or general technical debt, managing complexity between legacy and new systems becomes a challenge. But the end goal is still the same — safely and consistently deploy an application on any infrastructure. 

Atlas enables a unified workflow for developing, deploying, and maintaining applications. The result is one command for development: “vagrant up” and one command for deployment: “vagrant push”. The applications might be using different technologies, running on different infrastructure providers, or might even be a container, but the workflow is the same throughout: one command for development and deployment, now and forever. Developers and system administrators can now use one workflow from development to production.
