# Deploy to a hybrid cloud

Many modern applications are no longer contained on one cloud or one datacenter. Instead, infrastructure spans multiple datacenters and requires complex orchestration. While some provider-specific infrastructure management tools exist, it's still difficult to deploy, monitor, and maintain applications across multiple datacenters, whether public or private. Additionally, it's not uncommon for a staging environment to be on a public cloud, while production is on private infrastructure. Companies are forced to build out tooling for each environment, rather than using one foundation to move between them.

Atlas is one foundation to manage servers, VMs, containers, configuration management, and service discovery on any infrastructure provider. Since Atlas is cloud-agnostic, it allows a single configuration to be used to manage multiple providers, and to even handle cross-cloud dependencies. This simplifies management and orchestration, helping operators build large-scale multi-cloud infrastructures.
