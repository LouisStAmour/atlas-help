# Adopt DevOps in your organization
The advantages of DevOps are well established â€” deploy code more often, with greater certainty and clear visibility. Developers and sysadmins working together to streamline the application delivery process is the goal everyone strives for. But it's a difficult process to transition from legacy workflows that are often fragmented across different technology and infrastructure choices.

Atlas provides one foundation to gradually centralize workflows and transition your organization towards a DevOps mentality. Whether you've built custom solutions or use enterprise products for development environments, configuration management, artifact storage, deployment, or service discovery, Atlas takes a collaborative approach. You can read more about how Atlas integrates with specific software in the [guides section](/help/overview#guides).
