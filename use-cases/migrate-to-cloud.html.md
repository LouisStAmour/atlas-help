# Migrate your Infrastructure to the Cloud

The flexibility and scalability of cloud infrastructure is attractive as it allows companies to pay only for what computing resources they use. While physical datacenters may be less expensive if used efficiently, oftentimes the resource use is not optimal and results in excess cost. Although the cloud has many benefits for companies stuck on physical servers, the difficult transition process to the cloud is an overwhelming obstacle to migration. The process can't be a binary change - one day on physical servers and the next completely in the cloud - it must be gradual.

Atlas enables software teams to develop, deploy, monitor, and maintain applications across hybrid infrastructure environemnts. Half of your applications' services could run in a physical datacenter, and the other half on a public or private cloud. This allows teams to gradually convert one service at a time to run in the cloud, and still use Atlas as one foundation to manage and view the applications across providers. You can read more about how Atlas works across infrastructure providers in the [guides section](/help/overview#guides).
