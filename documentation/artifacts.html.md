## Documentation - Artifacts and Services

As explained in the [getting started tutorial](/help/getting-started/getting-started-overview), Atlas's foundation for building artifacts is built on HashiCorp's open source project [Packer](https://packer.io).

To learn about the internals of Packer in greater detail, visit the [Packer Documentation](https://packer.io/docs).
