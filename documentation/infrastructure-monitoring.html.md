## Documentation - Infrastructure Monitoring and Health

As explained in the [getting started tutorial](/help/getting-started/getting-started-overview), Atlas's foundation for monitoring and maintaining infrastructure is built on HashiCorp's open source project [Consul](https://consul.io). 

To learn about the internals of Consul in greater detail, visit the [Consul Documentation](https://consul.io/docs/index.html).
