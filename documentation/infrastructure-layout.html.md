## Documentation - Infrastructure and Layout

As explained in the [getting started tutorial](/help/getting-started/getting-started-overview), Atlas's foundation for planning and building infrastructure is built on HashiCorp's open source project [Terraform](https://terraform.io). 

To learn about the internals of Terraform in greater detail, visit the [Terraform Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html).
