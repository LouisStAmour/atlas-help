title: "Public Cloud Providers"

## Public Cloud - AWS, GCE, Rackspace, etc

Most public cloud providers have two offerings - Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas) and Platform as a Service (PaaS). For IaaS, these providers provision and run servers on a organization's behalf. For PaaS, these providers have infrastructure-specific tools to help with deployment, configuration, monitoring, load balancing, and auto-scaling. For more information on the differences between Atlas and a PaaS, please see our [comparison section](/help/comparison/).

Atlas is collaborative with the IaaS aspect of public cloud providers. It exists as an abstraction above public cloud providers, while still providing the same software toolkit. Rather than using provider-specific deployment, monitoring, and load balancing tools, configure those tools once with Atlas and have it work across infrastructure providers. Additionally since Atlas is infrastructure-agnostic, you can easily run a hybrid deployment across providers.
