## HashiCorp's Open Source Software - Vagrant, Packer, Serf, Consul, Terraform

The core of Atlas is HashiCorp open source software. Vagrant, Packer, Consul, and Terraform each solve one aspect of application delivery. Vagrant builds and manages development environments, Packer simplifies the creation of machine images, Consul is a solution for service discovery, and Terraform is a tool to deploy and provision infrastructure. Atlas is the glue that brings these tools together to form one continuous application delivery pipeline.
