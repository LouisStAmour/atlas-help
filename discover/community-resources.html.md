# Use community-built Vagrant boxes, AMIs, and other artifacts

Get a head start on your project by using community-built resources. You can search for and download Vagrant boxes, AMIs, and more on our [Discover page](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/discover). For example, bring up a fully-functional Laravel PHP development environment with just `vagrant up laravel/homestead --provider virtualbox`. View the Laravel box information [here](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/laravel/boxes/homestead).
