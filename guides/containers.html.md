# Using Atlas with containers like Docker or Rocket
Atlas is fully compatible with all aspects of Docker containers and in some cases makes Docker more approachable for production environments. Users are able to configure and build Docker containers with Packer templates, and then deploy and orchestrate those containers with Terraform. Additionally those containers can be run and tested locally with Vagrant.
